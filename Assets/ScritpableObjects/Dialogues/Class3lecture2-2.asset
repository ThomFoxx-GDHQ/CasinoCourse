  sentences:
  - Here we have a Class 2 machine.
  - You can see it looks almost identical to a Class 3 game, with the exception of
    this little group of boxes filled with different numbers which look like a bingo
    card.
  - This is because a class II slot machine is essentially a bingo game disguised
    as a slot machine.
  - There are still multiple reels which spin and stop to reveal an array of symbols,
  - but its what happens behind the screen where the major differences lie.
  - Class II games are connected to a central computer system,
  - and each time a player makes a wager on their respective machine,
  - the central computer system will draw a number of bingo balls to determine the
    outcome of the game, instead of the RNG used in Class III.
  - So just think about how a normal game of bingo works.
  - When the player makes a wager to spin the reels.
  - The central computer system draws out the bingo balls, and any matching numbers
    on the bingo card that appears on the machine are marked off.
  - Once the central computer system has drawn out the set number of ball,
  - the final pattern made on the bingo card is compared to the list of winning patterns
    listed in the help text.
  - ' Each winning pattern has a specified prize and reel stop position. '
  - All losing patterns are randomly assigned a reel stop position which based on
    the rules would not have a prize  associated with it.
  - So if there is match between the players bingo card and the list of winning patterns,
  - then the respective reel stop position is shown to the player, and the corresponding
    prize is awarded.
  - This means what the player sees with respect to the reels spinning and stopping
    like a class III slot machine,
  - is just a visual representation of a bingo game playing out.
