  - A Class III slot game is the type of slot game we are all familiar with, where
    there are multiple reels which stop one at a time to reveal an array of symbols
    positioned in different spots on the screen.
  - 'Here on the screen you will see there are 3 meters labeled:'
  - "\u201CCredit\u201D which is meter showing the amount of money you have in the
    game to play with,"
  - "\u201CWin\u201D the amount of money you have won for the game that was last
    played,"
  - "and \u201CBet\u201D the cost amount you have selected to gamble with."
  - Each game will have the denomination displayed somewhere on the screen.
  - The denomination is the value of each credit. For example, 5c denomination means
    each credit is worth 5c.
  - Therefore 100 credits are the same as 500 cents or $5.
  - Generally games with a higher denomination will have fewer available positions
    to get wins.
  - This allows the range of possible bets to be within a similar range to games
    with other denominations, but with access to higher prizes.
  - Here we have the information button, where you can access the help pages (sometimes
    also known as paytable) and sometimes game settings too.
  - Within the help pages all the rules of the game are listed,
  - detailing what all the prizes are and how they are awarded.
  - A reel window refers to the section of the reels which is made visible to the
    player.
  - A slot machine most commonly has 5 reels, but any number of reels can be used
    to make up a slot game, it all depends on the design of the game.
  - 'Each reel will have a line up of symbols on them. '
  - The number of symbols visible on each reel again depends on the design of the
    game, but the most common number is 3.
  - Each time a wager is placed, the reels will spin and then stop to display a combination
    of symbols randomly placed in each position of the reel window.
  - Now lets look inside to see how a Class 3 slot determines your prizes.
  - As you can see, each reel is made up of a list of symbols.
  - ' The length of the reel can vary, as does the distribution of the symbols.'
  - A class 3 slot machine works by using a random number generator (RNG) which is
    programmed into the machine.
  - When the player places a bet, the reels spin and the RNG assigns a random number
    to each reel to determine the stopping position.
  - Once the RNG has assigned a random number to each reel, the reels will stop to
    display the selected position on the reel and the associated symbol under them.
  - Depending on what and where the symbols are displayed and the rules of the game,
    a prize may or may not be awarded to the player.
