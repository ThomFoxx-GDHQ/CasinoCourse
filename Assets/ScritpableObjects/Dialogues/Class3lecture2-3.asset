  sentences:
  - A VLT stands for Video Lottery Terminal.
  - A VLT is kind of like a hybrid of Class 3 and Class 2.
  - It looks exactly the same a Class 3 Slot machine.....
  - but behaves more like a Class 2 machine.
  - All the VLT machines are connected to a central computer system,
  - but instead of Bingo games disguised as slots, its a lottery game disguised as
    slots.
  - This systems tend to operate like a scratch-off model
  - just like you buy a scratch-off from a pre-determined set of produced cards which
    have a set number of winners and losers,
  - 'the same goes for VLT bets. '
  - ' A certain number of winning and losing outcomes have been set up,'
  - "and with each wager, you \u201Cbuy\u201D an outcome is randomly determined from
    the central computer system (or terminal)"
  - ' Each winning outcome has a specified prize and reel stop position. '
  - All losing patterns are randomly assigned a reel stop position which based on
    the rules would not have a prize  associated with it.
  - 'So based on the outcome selected, then the respective reel stop position is
    shown to the player, and the corresponding prize is awarded. '
  - 'This means just like class 2, '
  - ' what the player sees with respect to the reels spinning and stopping like a
    class III slot machine,'
  - ' is just a visual representation of a lottery game playing out.'
